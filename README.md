# Mobile-Application-JUnit-Testing

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
I make my code functional and secure by writing clear, modular code and verifying it through thorough unit testing. Input validation and exception handling prevent errors, while consistent test coverage ensures reliability and protection against unsafe data.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
I review user requirements carefully and translate them into specific validation rules and features that match real-world use. By testing realistic scenarios, I ensure the program behaves as users expect and remains flexible to future needs.

**How do I approach designing software?**
I design software using an object-oriented, modular structure so each class has one clear purpose and responsibility. This approach makes the code easier to maintain, test, and scale while keeping performance and usability in mind.
